            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and how things work. When I went into highschool I was given the opportunity to learn more about coding and from there I found my passion for it. I fell into a rabbit hole; I had found it very easy to get lost in the code and the possibilities it offered. In highschool alone I was able to create multiple projects that helped me solidify my understanding of coding concepts. I also got certified in Python and I was close to getting certified in Java.</p>
